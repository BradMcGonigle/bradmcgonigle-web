title: "Inside the Federal Bureau of Way Too Many Guns"
summary:
  "There's no telling how many guns we have in America—and when one gets used in a crime, no way for the cops to connect it to its owner. The only place the police can turn for help is a Kafkaesque agency in West Virginia, where, thanks to the gun lobby, computers are illegal and detective work is absurdly antiquated. On purpose. Thing is, the geniuses who work there are quietly inventing ways to do the impossible."

Computers are illegal at the National Tracing Center.  Illegal!  Just think about that.
