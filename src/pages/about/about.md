Hi, I'm Brad — a frontend developer and product designer living in Orlando, Florida.

I've been working as a product designer and frontend developer for over 13 years. I've been lucky enough to work with and for a wide variety of companies ranging from agency-style client driven shops to venture capital funded startups to typical large-scale corporations.

When I'm not creating things on the web, I spend my time with my wife Shaina, our son Owen and our kitty Mila.

I'm an avid surfer, hockey player and all-round sports fan. _Fly Eagles Fly!_

I try to pretend to be a chef with my most recent culinary adventures into Sous Vide and smoking everything from meats to salt.
