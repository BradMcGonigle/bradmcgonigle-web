From Jason Snell's Six Colors post *[New Apple Photos app contains ‘UXKit’ framework](http://sixcolors.com/post/2015/02/new-apple-photos-app-contains-uxkit-framework/):*

> For a while, iOS developers have complained that the UIKit framework they use to develop apps isn’t available on the Mac, making it harder to apply the same tools and techniques and code they build for iOS to Mac apps.

> Today Apple dropped Photos for Mac via a developer release, and some developers are reporting signs that Apple has built this new app using something called UXKit, which sits above the Mac’s familiar AppKit frameworks and strongly resembles UIKit on iOS.

UXKit would surely bring a sudden shift in the complexities around bring iOS-style apps to OS X, the thing I mostly took away from this discovery was the pressure that must be on Apple engineers knowing that their code will be instantly dissected and analyzed.
