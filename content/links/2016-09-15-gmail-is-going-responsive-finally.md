title: "Gmail is going responsive...finally!"
summary:
  "Have you ever opened an email on your phone and something about the formatting just looks … off? Maybe the text is hard to read, or the buttons and links too small to tap. That’s because many emails are still formatted for computers' larger screens, which means reading them on mobile can be a hassle."

If there ever was a post that deserved the finally moniker then this is it.

Header styles and media query support is [coming to Gmail](https://gmail.googleblog.com/2016/09/better-emails-tailored-to-all-your-devices.html)

Litmus has [a nice summary](https://litmus.com/blog/gmail-to-support-responsive-email-design) of everything that will be supported later this month.
