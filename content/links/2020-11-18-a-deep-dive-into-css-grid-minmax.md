  A Deep Dive Into CSS Grid minmax()
summary: >-
  There are a lot of tutorials and guides out there that teach CSS grid in general, and I wrote about it multiple times. However, I noticed that there is a misunderstanding of the minmax() function as most of the articles are generic or don’t provide enough explanation and real-world use-cases.
