    Building a pure CSS animated SVG spinner
description: >-
    In this article I’ll show you how to level up your loading indicators with a pure-CSS animated SVG loader inspired by Google’s Chrome and YouTube spinner. What are we making? A good loading indicator helps users feel a sense of progress, and the spinner which Google uses for Chrome and YouTube is one of my favourites.
